# pixsqr
This app is lightweight and simple, perfect for cropping images to a 1:1 ratio for icons.
Despite being lightweight, it supports positioning, resizing, and operations using the Shift and Control keys.
To use it, transfer all the code within the HTML `<body>` tag. In the CSS, you may delete any code above `/* Must be included */`. JavaScript is essential.
